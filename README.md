# InvestmentPortfolioAnalyzer
This Ruby program calculates the returns generated by different investment portfolios using the Fintual API. It allows you to specify an investment start date, end date, and amount, and then analyzes various portfolios to determine the maximum potential return within the specified time frame.

## Prerequisites
Before running this program, ensure that you have Ruby installed on your system. You also need access to the Fintual API to fetch the necessary investment data.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Ruby if you haven't already.
3. Install the RSpec gem in order to run the tests.

## Usage
Ensure you have a portfolios.json file in the root directory with the required portfolio data. The portfolio must have the following format.
```
[
  {
    "risky_norris": 0.6,
    "moderate_pitt": 0.2,
    "conservative_clooney": 0.1,
    "very_conservative_streep": 0.1
  },
  {
    "risky_norris": 0.1,
    "moderate_pitt": 0.2,
    "conservative_clooney": 0.3,
    "very_conservative_streep": 0.4
  },
  ...
]
```

You can run the program using the following commands
```
cd app
ruby main.rb
```

Then, you have to enter the investment start date, end date, and amount. The dates must have the DD/MM/YYYY format and the amount must be a valid integer.

## Testing
This project includes tests using RSpec. You can run the tests with the following command:
```
rspec
```
