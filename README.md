# InvestmentPortfolioAnalyzer
This Ruby program calculates the returns generated by different investment portfolios using the Fintual API. It allows you to specify an investment start date, end date, and amount, and then analyzes various portfolios to determine the maximum potential return within the specified time frame.

## Prerequisites
Before running this program, ensure that you have Ruby installed on your system. You also need access to the Fintual API to fetch the necessary investment data.

## Usage
Ensure you have a portfolios.json file in the root directory with the required portfolio data. The portfolio must have the following format.

[
  {
    "risky_norris": 0.6,
    "moderate_pitt": 0.2,
    "conservative_clooney": 0.1,
    "very_conservative_streep": 0.1
  },
  {
    "risky_norris": 0.1,
    "moderate_pitt": 0.2,
    "conservative_clooney": 0.3,
    "very_conservative_streep": 0.4
  },
  ...
]

You can run the program using the following command
ruby main.rb
Then, you have to enter the investment start date, end date, and amount.

## Note
At the moment the start_date, end_date, and investment_amount variables in the code are placeholders. You can modify them as needed for your specific investment scenario.
